#Define a method that accepts 2 strings as parameters. The method returns the first string sorted by the second.
#To elaborate, the second string defines the ordering. 
#It is possible that in the second string characters repeat, so you should remove repeating characters, leaving only the first occurrence.
#Any character in the first string that does not appear in the second string should be sorted to the end of the result in original order.
